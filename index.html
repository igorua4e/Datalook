							<p>What is competitor analysis?</p>
						</div>
						<div class="analist__item-text">
							<p>Competitor analysis is an integral part of corporate strategy. It
								involves identifying key competitors and researching their
								products, sales, and marketing strategies.
							</p>
							<p>This provides you with a comprehensive understanding of
								your competitors' strengths and weaknesses compared to
								your own, which is critical for identifying your competitive
								advantage and strategy.
							</p>
							<p>Analyzing how competitors market their products helps to
								understand their positioning. For example, Nike might focus
								on emotional branding and celebrity ambassadors, while
								Adidas may emphasize product innovation and performance.
							</p>
							<p>Competitor analysis is not just about understanding your
								competitors, but also about strategically positioning your
								own business. It aids in making informed decisions regarding
								product development, marketing strategies, and overall
								business strategy, ensuring the maintenance of a competitive
								edge in the market.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="analist__item-title">
							<p>What is the purpose of the competitor analysis?</p>
						</div>
						<div class="analist__item-text">
							<p>Competitor analysis helps to identify both opportunities and
								threats in the market.
							</p>
							<p>Strategic decisions, whether about pricing, marketing,
								product features, or expansion, can be effectively guided
								through competitor analysis.
							</p>
							<p>Competitor analysis is a critically important aspect of
								business strategy. This process involves a deep analysis of
								the operations, strategies, and outcomes of your competitors
								to understand your own competitive advantage and areas for
								growth.
							</p>
							<p>Competitor analysis is a multifaceted process that involves
								identifying competitors, gathering and analyzing data,
								understanding strategies, and studying their successes and
								failures. It's not just about keeping up with the competition,
								but also about identifying unique opportunities for success.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="analist__item-title">
							<p>What types of competitor analysis are there?</p>
						</div>
						<div class="analist__item-text">
							<p>Comparative analysis.
							</p>
							<p>SWOT-analysis.
							</p>
							<p>Market positioning analysis.
							</p>
							<p>Financial analysis.
							</p>
							<p>Product and service analysis.</p>
							<p>Customer analysis.</p>
							<p>Digital presence analysis.</p>
							<p>Sales and distribution analysis.</p>
							<p>Advertising and marketing analysis.</p>
							<p>Strategic analysis.</p>
							<p>Pricing analysis.</p>
							<p>Operational activity analysis.</p>
							<p>Technological analysis.</p>
							<p>Benchmarking.</p>
							<p>In each of these examples, specific types of competitor
								analysis are used to gain insights into their market position,
								understand competitor strategies, and identify areas for
								improvement or differentiation.Â

						</div>
						<div class="analist__item-title">
							<p>Competitor analysis mistakes</p>
						</div>
						<div class="analist__item-text">
							<p>Neglecting smaller competitors: However, these smaller
								companies may be developing disruptive technologies or
								innovative strategies.
							</p>
							<p>Ignoring indirect competitors: Companies now face
								competition not only from direct rivals but also from
								businesses in different sectors offering substitute products or
								services.
							</p>
							<p>Misunderstanding competitors' strengths: Often, the focus is
								placed on studying weaknesses. However, examining their
								strengths can provide valuable insights for developing your
								own strategy.
							</p>
							<p>Incorrect data interpretation: Misinterpreting competitor data
								can lead to erroneous strategies.Â 
							</p>
							<p>
								Lack of continuous analysis: The market is constantly
								changing, along with competitors' strategies. Regular
								analysis is necessary to update and keep data current.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="analist__item">
						<div class="analist__item-card">
							<p>â€œ</p>
							<p>For example, Samsung continuously monitors its
								competitors - Apple, Huawei, and Xiaomi. It observes how
								Apple's focus on design and user experience sets its
								products apart, how Huawei's investments in research and
								development expand its market share, and how Xiaomi's
								aggressive pricing strategy captures the budget market
								segment.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="analist__item-card">
							<p>â€œ</p>
							<p>A Crayon survey revealed that companies conducting in-
								depth competitor analysis are three times more likely to
								achieve high efficiency. Furthermore, research by the
								Business Research Company indicates that companies
								regularly conducting competitor analysis experience, on
								average, a 10% faster growth rate than those that do not.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="analist__item-card">
							<p>â€œ</p>
							<p>The small cosmetic brand, GlowBeauty, had plans to expand
								its product line. However, competitor analysis revealed that
								similar products from other brands had recently faced
								failures. This understanding helped GlowBeauty avoid
								potential losses by reallocating its efforts into more
								promising product categories.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="analist__item-card">
							<p>â€œ</p>
							<p>The eco-friendly cleaning product company, GreenClean,
								analyzed the sales volumes and customer reviews of its
								competitors, identifying a lack of eco-friendly laundry
								detergents. They swiftly launched a new product line to fill
								this gap, capturing a 15% market share in this segment within
								a year.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="analist__item-card">
							<p>â€œ</p>
							<p>A manufacturing company like Caterpillar can analyze the
								production processes of a competitor like John Deere,
								noting that John Deere's investment in automation has led to
								a 10% reduction in production costs. This indicates a
								potential area for profit growth for Caterpillar.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="analist__item-card">
							<p>â€œ</p>
							<p>Companies' expenditures on digital marketing can reveal
								their strategic priorities. For instance, in the beauty industry,
								EstÃ©e Lauder allocated 65% of its marketing budget to digital
								channels in 2023, indicating the importance and profitability
								of online channels as a source of customer orders.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="analist__item-card">
							<p>â€œ</p>
							<p>A newcomer in the e-commerce sector, QuickShop, noticed
								during competitor analysis that none of its competitors
								offered a reliable same-day delivery service. Capitalizing on
								this gap, QuickShop introduced an express delivery option,
								which resulted in a 15% increase in customer numbers within
								the first 6 months.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="analist__item-card">
							<p>â€œ</p>
							<p>The cosmetic brand NYX analyzed the customer base of its
								competitor Maybelline and discovered that Maybelline had a
								strong and paying audience among women aged 30-44. This
								provided NYX with a compelling reason to expand its
								product line, attracting a new age group of customers and
								resulting in a 12% increase in revenue.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="analist__item-card">
							<p>â€œ</p>
							<p>For example, when McDonald's noticed the growing trend
								towards healthy eating, they introduced more salads and
								fruit options. As a result, salad sales increased by 46%.</p>
